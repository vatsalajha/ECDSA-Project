Clients are allowed to transfer any funds from any account to another account.
Not secure.
Applying Digital Signatures, only user with appropriate private keys can create
a signauture that allow them to move funds from one account to another.
Server can verify the signatures to move funds from one to another.
1. Incorporate Public key cryptography so transer can be completed with valid 
signatures.
2. The person sending transaction should verify that they own the private key to the 
address that is sending funds.

Single server on Backend handling transfers that is centralized. Don't worry about
distributed consesus for the project.
Using Elliptical Curve Digital Signatures - server only allows transfer that has 
been signed for by the person who owns associated address.
